·         processes project  - get results.
·         Breaking down a Project into manageable phases
Planning the project (think about)
a.    , including work breakdowns
b.	task lists
c.	schedule
d.	time
e.    requirements,
f.     materials required (often includes people)
g.	PERT charts
h.	GANTT charts

2. 	Defining the project,Analysis
a.    Including objectives
b.    constraints
c.	schedule
d.	expectations
e.	criteria for completion
f.     measures for success.

3. Design

4. Implementing and Coding the project
a.    including all required tasks
b.	performance against the planned schedule
c.	management of changes to the project objectives
5.	Testing & Analyzing the results of the project
a.    including both a project retrospective
b.	personal analysis for each project participant.

6. Deployment 
Handing in the final versions.

OK so this does not really include deployment and Maintenance which does occur in the  real world.  Look at the highlights.  These are the pieces we will focus on which will include everything at a very basic level.


1.    Definition Phase.
Your task:
1.	Decide and get approval form your game.  
See tasks above on chart.
Planning Phase 
In your shared work with every member of your group to complete the flowcharts and preliminary documents
2.	Work together to write out the basic steps - Algorithm/steps in your game.
3.	You will be rotating and completing each role.  (10 Days in the next 3 weeks.)
You will be managing the completed project completing an objective statement, deciding criteria, developing a Project Task List and creating a Project Schedule. (a GANTT chart and Pert chart can do many of these tasks pieces for you).
Roles for Teams of 5:
• Project Manager-Keeps group on schedule and on task in accordance with the GANTT/PERT chart. Directs the team, and the project. Communicates concerns with the Project Manager and teacher. Establishes and maintains communication with all team members (outside school/class too).
• Graphics Specialist , Materials Specialist & 2nd Coder - The researcher to find a better way to do something and cite properly, 2nd coder when required, GUI design.
• Head Programmer - The lead/main coder.
• Code Tester-Attempts to break program & Debug Specialist-Role given to the person best at solving errors.

Roles for Teams of 4:

Other roles as applicable.

Past example –is in Google classroom as is a Sheet with headings only if you are interested in a sheets version.

A bit on guidance on this task…
Projects Dates
This is the start date and completion date of the project. Start = last week, be specific on the start.  Finish = Dec. 18th.
Project Objective Statement
Students should know how to write an objective statement from the step.
Completion Criteria
In their groups, students need to talk about what the end result of the project will look like and how they will know when they are done. They need to determine what a quality assignment would look like and what they need to do to obtain that level of quality.
Project Task List (above) plus fill in other requirements
This is a critical part of the planning phase. The Project Task List determines all the work that needs to be done to meet the project completion criteria.  Group decides who will take which task and talk about how the task will be completed. Every task should have a backup person.  (You can fill that in completely.)

Project Schedule Students estimate the time (minutes) it will take to complete the tasks of a project. Also decide which tasks are dependent on another task.
 
This is team effort.  Remember to log what you did and what has been completed daily so that it does not get away from you.
 
Execution according to your timeline and tasks.  Fill that in, how did it go?
 
Day 1 no roles - startup and make decisions and get flowchart and Gantt and pert completed and submitted.

Day 2 - begin roles Rotation 1 (all groups)

Day 3, before Day 4 begins - hand in all documentation/products, code, reports, logs  from Role 1 (keep copy for your team too.)

Day 4 - Rotation 2 (Adopt previous work from person in first rotation - continue)

Day 5, before Day 6 begins -hand in all documentation/products, code, reports, logs  from Role 2 (keep copy for your team too.)

Day 6 - Rotation 3 (Adopt previous work from person in first rotation - continue)

Day 7, before Day 8 begins - hand in all documentation/products, code, reports, logs  from Role 3 (keep copy for your team too.)

Day 8 - Rotation 4 (Adopt previous work from person in first rotation - continue)

Day 9, before Day 10 begins - hand in all documentation/products, code, reports, logs  from Role 4 (keep copy for your team too.)

Day 10 - Rotation 5 (Adopt previous work from person in first rotation - continue)
{If you are in a group of 4, you may repeat rotation that will work best for the group.}

Day 11 - Finish project -  hand in all documentation/products, code, reports, logs  from Role 5 (keep copy for your team too.)

  Final Notes:
Your code must run without errors, even if you must leave out some features you had planned. 
There are no exceptions on this - no extensions, an absolute deadline
If people are absent, you will need to fill in for them.
All logs must be completed daily, and shared with the Project Manager. At the end of each rotation this will be handed into your teacher.  It will be used to help determine your mark for this each.  (Note some days you will have 4 or 5 tasks, particularly in the Project Manager role, other days just one task.  You will always have 1 task.

The first task I will be working on is:
I expect the first task to take:
The second task I will be working on is (please be specific):

The third task I will be working on is:
I expect the third  task to take:
The fourth task I will be working on is (please be specific):
I expect the fourth task to take
How complete is the first task you listed today ? (percentage)
When is the first task due?
How long did you spend on the first task you listed
Did something else come up that needed to be worked on more urgently?
Please describe what you worked on instead and why. Please state if this is completed too.

Github will be used to share all code.  Teams will be set up Monday/Monday night or Tuesday before class.  Please do not create your own.  Google Classroom folders will be set up for each role, and the dates will all be set to the last day.  Hand in your rotations as soon as it’s completed so you do not forget and need to find everything the last day taking time away from that day’s  work.
 
We will decide on the Rubric in class - I will provide a base that we will modify. (be ready to quickly discuss this as I do not want to take you away from the project.)
We need to schedule into the next 3 weeks, a test on Project Management theory and Debate topics.  We also need a class or part of a class for Malware and related issues.
